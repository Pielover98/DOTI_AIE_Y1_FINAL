### Game was developed in unreal engine

â€‹Marketplace is a game that was developed over the course of 6 weeks for the year one final at AIE with team DOTI. The concept of the game is that your a Robber inside a busy marketplace where you have to quickly steal as much stuff as you can by putting items in a stash before the timer runs out. You must avoid enemy guards patrolling the area. Key game play mechanics include,  Stealing items and adding them to an inventory, Holding physics items and throwing them, Guard and Crowd AI, A stash that when items are put in add to your total score, A gambling machine that you can spend funds on that spawn a random item, Random high value item spawner, And Special high value items some of which can be consumed for extra abilities or be put in the stash for more money, Others have super high value but have negative effects while holding them.
